# clean_git_branches
Clean Git Branches is a command-line tool that helps maintain a tidy Git repository by categorizing and displaying branches based on their status: deleted, untracked, tracked, and protected. It also streamlines branch management by automatically removing merged branches, excluding those specified as protected.
